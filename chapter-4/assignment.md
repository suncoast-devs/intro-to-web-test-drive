# If/Else

Over the next two weeks we will be adding JavaScript to our website.  Now that you have created the HTML and CSS, its time to use what we have learned to add more customization to our website with Javascript.

For this assignment you will make the dark mode/theme button more dynamic so that it toggles between light and dark mode. 


### In Class Example

- [https://glitch.com/~liz-cat-hotel](https://glitch.com/~liz-cat-hotel)

- [https://liz-cat-hotel.glitch.me/](https://liz-cat-hotel.glitch.me/)

- [Rolling dice](https://glitch.com/~class-example-0425)

### Slides

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create a function that will change the theme and button from dark to light and light to dark.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Add a third theme and allow the user to chose between the themes.
    - [ ] You will need to turn the button into a [select html element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select)

### Epic Mode 
- [ ] Allow the user to "randomize" their theme
