## [What is JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

- Designed by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich)

> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript))

- Not Java
- Client-side language
- The "muscle" of a website
- Allows you to reuse code

## How does Javascript work? 

- Javascript runs scripts
- Scripts are lines of code
- A line of code is a command that tells the computer what to do
- Examples of lines of code:
  - Increase the value of a counter
  - Change the css class of `<p>`
  - Update the value of `<h1>`
  - Set the value of a variable

### Variables

- a Variable is a value, that can change, depending on conditions or information passed to the program,
- Examples of Variables
  - const x = 5
  - const firstName = "Sherlock
  - let dayOfWeek = "Saturday"
  - let numberOfCupsOfCoffee = 1
  - var notThis = "hello"

#### Some Types of variables

- const x = 5 // Number
- const lastName = "Holmes" // string
- const stillAString = "255" // string

- there will be more next week

#### Basic math with variables

- const x = 5;
- const y = 10;
- const z = x + y; // Should be 15
- const a = x - y; // -5
- const firstName = "Sherlock";
- const lastName = "Holmes";
- const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "Sherlock Holmes"
- const fullName = firstName + lastName; // "SherlockHolmes"

## How does this compare to what we know

- There are 3 ways to run JS
  - Browser based JS: Loaded into a browser (Primarily what we are referring to)
  - Backend JS: JS that runs on Backend such as Node
  - JS that runs on the computer such as code that is powering app-app

## How to run JS in the console

The JavaScript console is where we can output messages to ourselves (the developer) that are helpful in many ways:

- Outputs values (the result of some computation)
- Outputs messages that let us know when some action has happened in our application
- Outputs errors that are important to us as a developer but not useful to the user

To Open: 

- Mac: Command + option + j
- Windows: control + shift + j
- Type in 2 + 2 then 'enter'
- type `console.log('Hello World')`

- Google Chrome Tool -- `inspect`
  - console tab: You can type live JS code into a browser and the browser executes the code
  - source tab: Shows you the JavaScript files loaded into the current page

## How to run JS in Browser

- HTML script tag

```html
<script>
  // JavaScript code would be here
</script>
```

- Link to separate JavaScript file

```html
  <script src="main.js">
```

## What is the DOM (Document Object Model)

- DOM: Browser's representation of your webpage in memory
- document - variable that is given by web page browser's JavaScript environment
- selectors

  - We can use the selectors we learned about with CSS to help us find/target elements on the page
  - querying selectors
  - `querySelector` > `querySelector` selects the very first `h1` element from document and returns it

        ```javascript
        document.querySelector('hi')
        -> <h1>Hello World</h1>
        ```

        ```javascript
        let header = document.querySelector('h1')
        header
        -> <h1>Hello World</h1>
        ```

  - `querySelectorAll` > given that there are 3 `h1` elements in the example document, to select all the `h1` elements from document

        ```javascript
        let allOurFirstDOM = document.querySelectorAll('h1')
        allOurFirstDOM
        -> NodeList(3) [h1,h1,h1]
        ```

  - [`NodeList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) is an array like list that browser gives us to represent collection of nodes.

- Why do we normally put our `<script>` tag at the end of our HTML?

  - scripts run right away so only the DOM that has been evaluated so far is available to us
  - So how do we ensure that the DOM is loaded when our JavaScript runs?
  - Use `DOMContentLoaded` event (see below in `Events`)


## functions


- data + behavior(actions taken on data) = programming
- functions are just variables whose value is the code to execute when you call that function
- named

  ```javascript
  function greet(nameOfPerson) {
    console.log('Hello ${nameOfPerson}')
  }

  greet()
  -> Hello undefined

  greet('Gavin')
  -> Hello Gavin

  name = 'Gavin'
  greet(name)
  -> Hello Gavin

  name = 'Gavin'
  greet(name + !!!!)
  -> Hello Gavin!!!!

  function greet(nameOfPerson, greeting) {
    console.log(`${greeting}, ${nameOfPerson}`)
  }
  greetFunction('Gavin', 'Howdy')
  -> Howdy, Gavin
  ```

  Another way to write function using `arrow function` (newer way in ES6)

  ```javascript
  let greetFunction = (nameOfPerson, greeting) => {
    console.log(`${greeting}, ${nameOfPerson}`)
  }

  greetFunction('Gavin', 'Howdy')
  -> Howdy, Gavin
  ```

- anonymous
  - functions that are dynamically declared at runtime. They're called anonymous functions because they aren't given a name in the same way as normal functions

## Events

- JS and DOM are event based world where we are waiting for events to happen and we react to them
- [what is an event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/events)
- In JS we can pass around functions to other functions
- listening for events
- attaching code to events

```javascript
const main = () => {
  document.querySelector('h1').textContent += '?'
}

// when DOMContentLoaded happens, call main
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main)
```
