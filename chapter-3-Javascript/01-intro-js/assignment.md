# Beginning JavaScript.

Over the next two weeks we will be adding JavaScript to our website.  Now that you have created the HTML and CSS, its time to use what we have learned to add more customization to our website with Javascript.

For this assignment you will be allowing a user to customize the website experience by creating a button that applies a dark mode theme.   

For the dark mode theme, you will create separate set of CSS classes that will be applied when a user presses a button called Dark Mode.

### Requirements

- Apply the ideas that you learn about in class

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create a dark mode theme in CSS and apply it via a button and JavaScript.
- [ ] Add a second button to remove the dark mode theme.
