# If/Else

Over the next two weeks we will be adding JavaScript to our website.  Now that you have created the HTML and CSS, its time to use what we have learned to add more customization to our website with Javascript.

For this assignment you will make the dark mode/theme button more dynamic so that it toggles between light and dark mode. 


### In Class Example

- [https://glitch.com/~liz-cat-hotel](https://glitch.com/~liz-cat-hotel)

- [https://liz-cat-hotel.glitch.me/](https://liz-cat-hotel.glitch.me/)

- [Rolling dice](https://glitch.com/~class-example-0425)
