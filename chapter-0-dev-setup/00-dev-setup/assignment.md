# Hello, World

Welcome to the Intro to Web Crash Course. Over the next couple lessons we will be exploring how to create a simple web app using the basic building blocks of the web.

We will be covering a wide amount of topics at a very fast pace. For your first assignment, I want you to read through some HTML guides and resources.

If you want to get your hands dirty, then check out Adventure mode.
