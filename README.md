## Course Description:

Throughout this six-week course, students learn the basics of front-end web development. Students will learn the basic practices, fundamentals, and ideas behind creating dynamic websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a focus on applied knowledge, students will get hands-on training using HTML to create semantic pages structures, CSS to implement modern designs, and JavaScript to make the pages dynamic and interactive. This course can also be utilized as a preview to the immersive 12-week program, giving students new to development exposure to what the full-time course would feel like and a great introduction to being a developer.

During the course, students will build a multiple page application, implementing the topics and ideas that are learned during class.
