## Course Outline

Over the course, you will be builing a website for a hotel, restaurant, flower shop, or beauty salon/barber.  An example would be creating a clone of [https://sdg-tourism.netlify.com](https://sdg-tourism.netlify.com). Use the topic of the day to build out different sections.

We will be using glitch.com to create your website.  It is a free service that allows you to create and edit your website in the browser.  During the last week, we will explore the developer environment and build a project 'from scratch.'
