## Lecture notes

- Go over HTML notes
  - Semantic vs non-semantic
- Review the good and bad of inline styling
- What is CSS?
  - cascading style sheets
  - allows us to make a website look how we want it to
  - a way to apply styules to your website both globally and singularly
  - a set of rules
- CSS Rules
  - a set of properties which have values set to update how HTML content is displayed
  - selectors reference the HTML tags to apply styles specifically to them
- example:
  - ```css
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      background-color: yellow;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }

    p {
      color: red;
    }
    ```
- Property and Value:
  - Property is the first part
    - ie background-color, height, font-weight, etc
  - value is what comes afer the colon
    -ie - blue, yellow, 1px solid black
  - there are over 300 different css properties to chose from. HAVE FUN WITH IT!
- Class selectors
  - Classes are selectors we use to apply more specific rule sets 
  - If you don't want to apply it to every `<p>` tag but to a select few you would add `class=yourClassName`
    - Classes are represented in CSS with a period in front: `.yourClassName`
- ID Selectors
  - IDs are even more specific selectors
  - If you want to apply to only one specific item in the document you would add `id="yourIdName"`
    - IDs are represented in CSS with a `#` in front: `#yourIdName`
